[APPLICATIONS PROD] Response sent successfully - 20 applications in 2471ms

So again, your app is working perfectly at the end of the request cycle.

❌ Immediate SIGTERM Right After Success

system: received signal terminated
[SIGTERM PROD] Received SIGTERM signal
This tells us Replit is shutting your app down immediately after completing the request.

These errors are being logged before your Express server is fully initialized. Only later, this appears:

🛑 Problem: Replit Terminates Your App Too Aggressively
This cycle reveals a key Replit behavior:

Your app gets killed (SIGTERM) even though it's still actively being used

When it restarts, incoming requests hit before the server is ready, causing proxy errors and possibly 500s on your frontend

This is particularly problematic for:

Free Replit plans

Static / basic deployments that don’t reserve resources

Apps with a few seconds of boot time (DB, auth, routes, etc.)

✅ Solutions & Mitigations
🔧 1. Add Replit-Ready Health Guarding
Make your app more robust by responding early to Replit’s proxy even if some things are still warming up.

Add this to your index.js or wherever you set up Express:

js
Copy
Edit
let isServerReady = false;

app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  return res.status(isServerReady ? 200 : 503).send(isServerReady ? 'OK' : 'Warming up');
});

// Once everything is initialized:
isServerReady = true;
🔁 2. Retry Critical API Calls on Frontend
Wrap your frontend fetch like so:

js
Copy
Edit
const fetchWithRetry = async (url, retries = 5, delay = 1000) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < retries; i++) {
    try {
      const res = await fetch(url);
      if (res.ok) return res.json();
    } catch (err) {
      console.warn(`Retrying (${i + 1})...`);
    }
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, delay));
  }
  throw new Error(`Failed to fetch ${url} after ${retries} retries`);
};
This avoids user-facing failures during wakeup.
